# ArtCat

This Windows Store app allows artists to keep a catalogue of their work, including images and sales.

It's a work in progress, designed for my wife, who is an independent [artist][camhanaich].

ArtCat uses [MarcelloDB][marcellodb], an embedded noSQL database for UWP and Xamarin apps, to store the catalogue data.
